+ VERSION 1.3.0-A11Preview;2023-05-15
- THIS IS A PREVIEW RELEASE ONLY for Avalonia 11.0.0-preview8
- Changes necessary for Avalonia 11.0.0-preview8
- Update of pupnet.conf and deploy files to PupNet 1.5.0


+ VERSION 1.2.1;2023-05-18
- Update to reflect changes concerning artifact directory in .NET8 Preview 4.


+ VERSION 1.2.0;2023-04-23
- Added detection of application build output in the new '.artifacts' directory that will come into play with .NET8.
- Added solution directory tree traverse to find the Directory.Packages.props file when AvaloniaVersion is null. This is needed if the version is defined only globally, and not overridden in the csproj.
- Added check for the presence of the PackageVersion tag. This is needed since the Directory.Packages.props could be the only place where the Version attribute is defined.
- Added check for the presence of the VersionOverride attribute. This is needed since the version used by a project could still be different from the global one, at least in theory.
- Increased height of SettingsWindow.
- RPM and DEB packages now specify full .NET dependencies.
- Bugfix: XAML code text and debug output was hidden (fixes a bug introduced in 1.1.0).
- Bugfix: Error in persisting size of main window between launches.
- Bugfix: Crash when trying open recent but non-existing solution file.
