# FU Microsoft and your damn nagging! Begone! Leave me alone!

# None of these new conventions (disabled below) make life simpler or better --
# they only make things more complex and cryptic.

# How is "[.. list]" better and simpler than "list.ToArray()"?

# The latter is clear and short and everyone knows what it does. The former is some kind
# of regular expression puzzle or a weird LISP-like statement.

# In endlessly deprecating perfectly good code and adding new and pointless syntax, MS
# are polluting the C# language. I'm not saying all changes are bad, but +50% of are.

# When you know how to write something simply, you just write it. When you have half a dozen
# different but trivial ways to do the same damn thing, you have to consult to the web at every
# step. Moreover, the ceaseless nagging from the IDE to update perfectly good code to the latest
# crackpot convention becomes an end in itself. This is not programming; it is mere technocracy.
