PULL REQUESTS

By submitting a pull request for this project, you agree to assign your copyright of the
contribution to the project owner (merged with or without minor changes). You assert that you have
full power to assign such copyright.

This would allow us to, for example, change the license of the project or to transfer the ownership
of the project to someone else without your further consent. We require this so that we do not have
to ask everyone who has ever contributed.

If you feel uncomfortable about this, please do not make a pull request.
